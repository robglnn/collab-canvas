## 🎓 Key Concepts to Understand

Before starting implementation, make sure you understand:

1. **OpenAI Function Calling** - How AI chooses functions to call
2. **Firestore Real-Time Listeners** - How multi-user sync works
3. **Rate Limiting Patterns** - Per-user and per-resource limits
4. **Queue Management** - FIFO processing with timeouts
5. **React Custom Hooks** - Managing complex state logic
6. **Permission Systems** - Respecting shape locks

Refer to **AI_AGENT_PRD.md** for detailed explanations.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start small** - Get one command type working first
2. **Test continuously** - Use multiple browser windows
3. **Monitor costs** - OpenAI charges per API call
4. **Handle errors gracefully** - Show helpful messages
5. **Keep prompts concise** - Reduces API costs
6. **Use low temperature** - More consistent results
7. **Test edge cases** - Empty input, timeouts, locks
8. **Deploy early** - Catch production issues sooner

---

## 🔐 Security Reminders

- ⚠️ **NEVER** commit API keys to Git
- ✅ Use `.env.local` for secrets
- ✅ Validate all user input
- ✅ Sanitize before execution
- ✅ Respect shape permissions
- ✅ Enforce rate limits
- ✅ Update Firestore security rules

---

## 🎉 You're Ready!

All documentation is complete and ready for implementation. Follow the task breakdown in **tasks.md** and refer to the detailed specs as needed.

Good luck building the AI Canvas Agent! 🚀
