# Multi-Canvas System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive multi-canvas system with user-specific canvases, permissions, and sharing capabilities.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Files Page (Default Landing Page)
- **Location**: `collabcanvas/src/components/FilesPage.jsx`
- Users land on the Files page after login
- Displays 3 user-specific canvases as preview buttons
- Each canvas has a unique color-coded preview
- Canvas naming functionality (rename canvases)
- Share button with emoji (👤) for managing collaborators

### 2. Canvas Sharing System
- **Location**: `collabcanvas/src/components/CanvasShareMenu.jsx`
- Add collaborators by email address
- Remove collaborator access
- Generate and copy shareable invite links
- Invite links automatically add users to canvas when clicked

### 3. Navigation System
- **Files button** (📁): Navigate to Files page from anywhere
- Button is disabled when already on Files page
- Located in user account dropdown menu in top bar
- To return to a canvas, click on it from the Files page

### 4. Permission System
- **Location**: `collabcanvas/src/components/PermissionDeniedBanner.jsx`
- Checks user permissions before allowing canvas access
- Owner always has access
- Collaborators must be in the `sharedWith` list
- Permission denied banner with auto-redirect to Files page

### 5. Multi-Canvas Data Structure
**Firestore Structure:**
```
canvases/
  ├── user_{userId}_canvas_1/
  │   ├── metadata (name, color, sharedWith[], inviteToken, ownerId)
  │   ├── objects/
  │   ├── cursors/
  │   ├── presence/
  │   └── comments/
  ├── user_{userId}_canvas_2/
  ...
  └── user_{userId}_canvas_3/
```

## Files Created

### New Components
1. **FilesPage.jsx** + CSS - Main files page with canvas grid
2. **CanvasShareMenu.jsx** + CSS - Share/invite management modal
3. **PermissionDeniedBanner.jsx** + CSS - Permission error screen

### Updated Components
1. **App.jsx** - Added routing logic and permission checks
2. **Auth.jsx** - Added Files/Canvas navigation buttons to user menu
3. **Canvas.jsx** - Now accepts `canvasId` prop for multi-canvas support

### Updated Services/Hooks
1. **firestoreService.js** - Added multi-canvas functions:
   - `getUserCanvases()` - Get user's 5 canvases
   - `checkCanvasPermission()` - Verify access rights
   - `addCanvasCollaborator()` / `removeCanvasCollaborator()` - Manage sharing
   - `updateCanvasName()` - Rename canvases
   - `getCanvasIdByInviteToken()` - Handle invite links
   - Canvas-specific CRUD operations

2. **useFirestore.js** - Added `canvasId` parameter for multi-canvas subscriptions
3. **useCanvas.js** - Added `canvasId` parameter, updated all operations

## User Flow

### First Time Login
1. User signs in with Google
2. Automatically lands on Files page
3. Sees 3 blank canvases (Canvas 1, 2, 3)
4. Each canvas is initialized with unique color
5. Click any canvas to open it

### Canvas Sharing
1. Click 👤 button on a canvas card
2. Share menu opens with:
   - Invite link (copy to clipboard)
   - Add collaborator by email
   - List of current collaborators
   - Remove access button for each collaborator

### Invite Link Flow
1. Owner shares invite link: `?invite={token}`
2. Invitee clicks link
3. System automatically:
   - Finds canvas by token
   - Adds invitee's email to `sharedWith` array
   - Opens canvas for invitee
   - Clears invite token from URL

### Permission Denied
1. User tries to access unauthorized canvas
2. Permission check fails
3. Shows "Permission Denied" banner with 🔒
4. Auto-redirects to Files page after 3 seconds
5. "Go to My Files Now" button for instant redirect

## Navigation
- **User Menu** → Click avatar in top-right
- **Files Button** → Navigate to Files page (disabled if already there)
- **Settings** → Placeholder for future settings
- **Sign Out** → Sign out and return to login
- To open a canvas → Go to Files page and click the canvas you want

## Technical Details

### State Management
- `currentPage`: 'files' or 'canvas'
- `currentCanvasId`: Active canvas ID
- `permissionDenied`: Boolean for access control
- Conditional rendering based on `currentPage`

### Performance Optimizations
- Canvas metadata cached locally
- Only subscribe to active canvas objects
- Presence tracking only on canvas page
- Color-based previews (no expensive thumbnail generation)

### Security
- Email-based permission checks
- Owner verification on all operations
- Firestore rules should be updated to enforce permissions

## Default Canvas Names
- Canvas 1
- Canvas 2
- Canvas 3

Users can rename any canvas using the edit button (✏️).

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Flow
- [x] User logs in → lands on Files page
- [x] Files page shows 3 canvases
- [x] Click canvas → opens canvas
- [x] Click avatar → see Files navigation button
- [x] Files button disabled when on Files page
- [x] Share menu renders outside card to prevent hover conflicts

### Sharing Flow
- [ ] Click 👤 button → opens share menu
- [ ] Add email → appears in collaborator list
- [ ] Copy invite link → can paste and share
- [ ] Remove collaborator → removes from list
- [ ] Invited user clicks link → gets access

### Permission Flow
- [ ] Try accessing unauthorized canvas → shows permission denied
- [ ] Permission denied auto-redirects after 3s
- [ ] "Go to Files" button works immediately

### Canvas Operations
- [ ] Rename canvas → updates everywhere
- [ ] Multiple browsers → see same canvases
- [ ] Canvas owner can edit
- [ ] Collaborators can edit
- [ ] Non-collaborators blocked

## Next Steps (Recommended)

1. **Update Firestore Security Rules** - Add permission checks to rules:
```javascript
match /canvases/{canvasId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && (
    resource.data.ownerId == request.auth.uid ||
    request.auth.token.email in resource.data.sharedWith
  );
  allow write: if request.auth != null && (
    resource.data.ownerId == request.auth.uid ||
    request.auth.token.email in resource.data.sharedWith
  );
}
```

2. **Test with Multiple Users** - Open in multiple browsers/incognito windows

3. **Add Analytics** - Track canvas usage and sharing metrics

4. **Canvas Thumbnails** - Optionally add visual previews later

5. **Shared Canvas Discovery** - Show canvases shared with user on Files page

## Notes

- Default flow now uses conditional rendering (no React Router)
- Fast and stable for the current use case
- All canvas operations support multi-canvas IDs
- Backwards compatible with legacy `main` canvas for existing data
- Invite tokens are unique per canvas and persistent until regenerated
