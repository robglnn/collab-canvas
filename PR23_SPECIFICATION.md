# PR #23: Shape Comments System - Specification

**Branch:** `feature/comments`  
**Goal:** Add shape-specific comments accessible via right-click context menu

---

## Overview

The Comments System allows users to add, view, edit, and delete comments on any shape (rectangle, circle, text, line) in the canvas. Comments are accessed through a submenu that opens when users right-click a shape and select "Comments" from the context menu.

---

## User Experience Flow

1. **Access Comments:**
   - User right-clicks on any shape (rect, circle, text, line)
   - Context menu opens with existing options (Copy, Duplicate, etc.)
   - New "Comments üí¨" option appears in the menu
   - Click "Comments" to open the comments submenu

2. **View Comments:**
   - Submenu displays to the right (or left if no space) of context menu
   - Shows list of all comments on that specific shape
   - Each comment shows:
     - User initials (first letter of first + last name)
     - Timestamp: "YY Month Day hh:mm:ss" format (24-hour time)
     - Comment text (up to 100 characters)
     - Edit icon (‚úèÔ∏è) and Delete icon (üóëÔ∏è)
   - Empty state: "No comments yet" if no comments exist

3. **Add New Comment:**
   - Text input box at bottom of submenu
   - Character counter shows remaining characters (100 max)
   - Type comment and click green checkmark ‚úì to submit
   - Comment appears immediately for all users (real-time)

4. **Edit Comment:**
   - Click edit icon (‚úèÔ∏è) next to any comment
   - Text transforms into editable textarea
   - Green checkmark ‚úì to save, red X ‚úó to cancel
   - Edited comments show "(edited)" indicator
   - Real-time update visible to all users

5. **Delete Comment:**
   - Click delete icon (üóëÔ∏è) next to comment
   - Confirmation prompt: "Delete this comment?"
   - On confirm, comment is soft-deleted (not shown in UI)
   - Deletion is immediate and visible to all users
   - **Undo Support:** Press Ctrl+Z to rescue deleted comment (works once)
   - After second deletion or undo history clear, comment is permanently deleted from database

## Technical Specification

### Data Model

**Firestore Collection:** `/canvases/main/comments/{commentId}`

```javascript
{
  id: string,                    // Auto-generated UUID
  shapeId: string,               // ID of shape this comment belongs to
  text: string,                  // Comment text (max 100 chars)
  userId: string,                // User who created the comment
  userName: string,              // User's display name
  userInitials: string,          // Extracted initials (e.g., "JD")
  createdAt: timestamp,          // When comment was created
  updatedAt: timestamp,          // When comment was last edited
  deleted: boolean,              // Soft delete flag (can be undone once)
  deletedAt: timestamp | null,   // When comment was deleted
  permanentlyDeleted: boolean    // True after undo window expires
}
```

### Firestore Indexes

Composite index required:
- Collection: `comments`
- Fields: `shapeId` (Ascending) + `deleted` (Ascending) + `createdAt` (Descending)

### Security Rules

```javascript
match /canvases/{canvasId}/comments/{commentId} {
  // Authenticated users can read non-deleted comments
  allow read: if request.auth != null && resource.data.deleted == false;
  
  // Authenticated users can create comments
  allow create: if request.auth != null 
    && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  
  // Users can update/delete their own comments
  allow update, delete: if request.auth != null 
    && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

### Real-Time Sync

- Use `onSnapshot()` listener filtered by `shapeId` and `deleted == false` and `permanentlyDeleted == false`
- Comments appear instantly for all users when added/edited/deleted
- Optimistic updates for local user (immediate feedback)
- Automatic rollback if Firestore write fails

### Undo/Redo Integration

- Comment deletion tracked in undo history as "Delete Comment" action
- First deletion: Set `deleted: true`, keep in database, can be rescued with Ctrl+Z
- Undo restores comment: Set `deleted: false`, comment reappears
- Second deletion or undo history clear: Set `permanentlyDeleted: true`, remove from Firestore
- Permanent deletion cleanup can happen immediately or via scheduled job

## UI Components

### 1. CommentsSubmenu Component

**Location:** `src/components/CommentsSubmenu.jsx`

**Props:**
```javascript
{
  shapeId: string,           // Shape to show comments for
  x: number,                 // X position of parent context menu
  y: number,                 // Y position of parent context menu
  onClose: function          // Callback to close submenu
}
```

**Features:**
- Positioned to right of context menu (or left if no space)
- Scrollable comment list (max height: 400px)
- Text input with character counter
- Real-time comment updates
- Edit/delete functionality per comment

### 2. ContextMenu Component Updates

**Location:** `src/components/ContextMenu.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Add "Comments üí¨" menu item after Duplicate
- On click, set state to show CommentsSubmenu
- Pass shapeId to submenu
- Keep context menu open when submenu is active

### 3. useComments Hook

**Location:** `src/hooks/useComments.js`

**Functions:**
```javascript
{
  comments: array,                           // Array of comments for shape
  loading: boolean,                          // Loading state
  addComment: async (shapeId, text),        // Add new comment
  updateComment: async (commentId, text),   // Edit comment
  deleteComment: async (commentId, firstDelete), // Soft or permanent delete
  // firstDelete = true: soft delete (can undo)
  // firstDelete = false: permanent delete
}
```

---

## Timestamp Format

**Display Format:** "YY Month Day hh:mm:ss"

**Examples:**
- `24 Oct 19 14:32:15`
- `25 Jan 05 09:05:48`
- `24 Dec 31 23:59:59`

**Implementation:**
```javascript
function formatTimestamp(timestamp) {
  const date = timestamp.toDate(); // Firestore timestamp
  const year = String(date.getFullYear()).slice(-2);
  const month = date.toLocaleString('en', { month: 'short' });
  const day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
  const hours = String(date.getHours()).padStart(2, '0');
  const minutes = String(date.getMinutes()).padStart(2, '0');
  const seconds = String(date.getSeconds()).padStart(2, '0');
  
  return `${year} ${month} ${day} ${hours}:${minutes}:${seconds}`;
}
```

---

## User Initials Extraction

**Format:** First letter of first name + first letter of last name

**Examples:**
- "John Doe" ‚Üí "JD"
- "Alice" ‚Üí "A"
- "Bob Smith Jones" ‚Üí "BS" (first + second word)
- "" ‚Üí "?" (fallback)

**Implementation:**
```javascript
function extractInitials(userName) {
  if (!userName) return '?';
  const words = userName.trim().split(/\s+/);
  if (words.length === 1) {
    return words[0][0].toUpperCase();
  }
  return (words[0][0] + words[1][0]).toUpperCase();
}
```

## Edge Cases & Validation

### Input Validation
- ‚úÖ Max 100 characters enforced in UI and backend
- ‚úÖ Empty comments are rejected
- ‚úÖ Trim whitespace before submission
- ‚úÖ Show character counter (100 - current length)

### Multi-User Scenarios
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates: New comments appear instantly
- ‚úÖ Edit conflicts: Show error if comment deleted while editing
- ‚úÖ Multiple users editing same shape: All comments visible

### Positioning
- ‚úÖ Submenu opens to right of context menu
- ‚úÖ If no space on right, open to left
- ‚úÖ Adjust vertical position to stay in viewport
- ‚úÖ Handle edge of screen gracefully

### Empty States
- ‚úÖ "No comments yet" when no comments exist
- ‚úÖ Encourage users to add first comment

### Performance
- ‚úÖ Filter by shapeId to avoid loading all comments
- ‚úÖ Only load non-deleted and non-permanently-deleted comments
- ‚úÖ Pagination if more than 50 comments (future enhancement)

### Deletion & Undo
- ‚úÖ First deletion: Soft delete, can be rescued with Ctrl+Z
- ‚úÖ Undo restores comment exactly as it was
- ‚úÖ Second deletion or undo clear: Permanent deletion from database
- ‚úÖ Track deletion state in undo history
- ‚úÖ Cleanup permanently deleted comments immediately

## Questions & Clarifications

**Answered:**
- ‚úÖ Character limit: 100 characters
- ‚úÖ Timestamp format: "YY Month Day hh:mm:ss"
- ‚úÖ Access method: Right-click context menu ‚Üí "Comments" ‚Üí submenu
- ‚úÖ User initials: First letter of first + last name

- ‚úÖ Submit: Green checkmark button
- ‚úÖ Delete with undo: Ctrl+Z rescues once, second delete is permanent

**For future consideration:**
- Should there be a notification when someone comments on a shape you created?
- Should comments support @mentions?
- Should there be a comment count indicator on shapes?
- Should comments be exportable/printable?

**Total Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

**Priority:** Medium (enhances collaboration but not core to canvas functionality)

**Dependencies:** None (can be implemented independently)
